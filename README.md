## How It's Made

CareConnect is a full-stack application developed using the following technologies:

**Frontend: HTML, EJS, CSS, JavaScript
**Backend: Node.js
**Database: MongoDB

The application utilizes CRUD API functionality to facilitate user registration, volunteer matching, and overall management of volunteer activities in nursing homes. Here's a brief overview of the development process:

**Database Design: I structured the MongoDB database to efficiently store user information, nursing home details, and volunteer activities.

**Backend Development: Using Node.js, I created robust APIs to handle user registration, authentication, and volunteer matching.

**Frontend Implementation: The frontend, developed with HTML, EJS, and CSS, provides a user-friendly interface for volunteers to sign up and browse available opportunities.

**Interactive Features: CareConnect includes dynamic features using JavaScript to enhance the user experience and make the volunteer matching process seamless.
